I don't normally do this, but I think this is interesting enough to be worth a cross-post.  Jonathan Locke (originator of the [Wicket](<http://wicket.apache.org>) framework) has [proposed](<http://web.mac.com/jonathan.locke/iWeb/JonathanLocke/Blog/3A1221CA-EF4E-4CF1-B5E7-8B4E7BFE3EB8.html>) two polls basically asking the question: Would you pay Sun for a port of Java 6 on OS X, and if so, how much?

Personally, I think it's an interesting question.  Probably half of the opinions I've seen about the state (or lack thereof) of Java on Leopard have ended with railing against Sun for not handling Java on that OS itself.  Of course, James Gosling [already officially debunked](<http://blogs.sun.com/jag/entry/solaris_and_os_x_continued>) why Sun _isn't_ handling Java on Mac (Apple wanted to do it), but that doesn't stop people from spreading the FUD that Sun is just being lazy.

The fact remains though that Apple has really dropped the ball on this one.  Whether Jobs likes it or not, Java is a relevant force in computing today, and no mainstream OS is complete without a working JVM.  Despite this fact, Apple has given no indication that it is even interested in releasing Java 6 for Leopard, nor does it seem to care that Java 5 doesn't work properly.  Given these facts, it only makes sense that someone else will need to step forward and carry the torch of Java on Mac.  Who better than Sun?

But the million dollar question here (well, not _quite_ that much) is how much would you be willing to pay for Sun (or any other company for that matter) to port Java 6 to MacOS X?  $50?  $99?  Cast your vote on the polls below:
