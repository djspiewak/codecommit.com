# Gun for Hire (off topic)

Just in case you thought Christmas was over, I have a late gift for the world: I'm available for hire!  Ok, so maybe this wasn't exactly the stocking-stuffer you were expecting, but it's the thought that counts.

I'm announcing my availability for employment as a part-time developer.  Those of you who follow this blog are probably already familiar with my areas of expertise, so I don't think there is a need to bore you with a rehash.  Resume available on request!

Anyway, my preference would be a project where I get to use multiple different languages, particularly Scala and Clojure, but I'm flexible.  If you think my skills would make a positive addition to your team, [shoot me an email](<mailto:djspiewak@gmail.com>)!
