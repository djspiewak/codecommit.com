# About

Back in early 2007, the global economy was just about to tip into a recession which would have ripple effects for a whole generation of software engineers (myself included), and I was just finishing up my brief stint as a paid writer while also holding down a few software consulting gigs and full time undergraduate coursework. Oh, the energy of youth...

Anyway, for reasons I don't fully remember, I decided to spin up a blog and begin seriously producing weekly articles about interesting things that I was learning or just wanted to share. This driving impetus helped me in ways I really couldn't have imagined when I began. Most obviously, it helped me become a better writer (or, at least, a more *practiced* writer). Far less obviously though, this commitment pushed me to carve out time to learn and explore things that I might not have ever picked up otherwise, including an obscure language from a Swiss university called Scala.

When I wrote the very first post in the series, [Scala for Java Refugees](/blog/scala/roundup-scala-for-java-refugees.md), I didn't really know much about Scala, but I *did* know that it was really difficult to find information about it. If memory serves, the articles which helped me the most at the time were [Alex Blewitt's](https://alblue.bandlem.com) and [Nathan Hamblen's](https://github.com/n8han). Sadly, I think the latter articles are lost to the mists of time, but I'm forever grateful to both for giving me the tools to build the foundation of what would come later.

These articles, along with some (not all!) that I published thereafter, found an audience in the then-rapidly growing Scala community. They led directly to employment opportunities, more than a decade of frequent participation in the conference circuit (especially focusing on Scala and niche programming languages), and many many wonderful people I now have the privilege to call friends and colleagues.

The writing slowly tapered off as I spent more of that energy on conference presentations and less on long-form articles. As I've grown (or at least, aged) and learned so much more about all of these topics, many of the positions I espoused and the ideas I championed in this era have increasingly seemed to me far more apparently incorrect, or at the very least, wildly incomplete. Despite this, I have left all of the original writing as it was. The internet deserves to remember all my wrongness, past and present.

In the intervening years, this whole blog (which was structured as a modestly customized WordPress instance) fell into a snake pit buried under multiple layers of bitrot, most of which involved things like PHP security vulnerabilities and long-deprecated hosting types (themselves migrated to, then superseded by *other* long-deprecated hosting types). Due to basic security hygiene, my hosting provider took the whole thing offline and declared it a superfund site almost a decade ago (as of this writing). I've taken a few attempts at shaving the yaks and bringing it up to par over the years, but the mountain was just too much to climb and, more importantly, involved PHP.

What you see now is a relatively herculean outcome involving a ton of scripts, HTML, SQL, and PHP parsing, quite a lot of manual tweaking, liberal use of browser devtools on the Wayback Machine, an impressively mature Scala library and tooling ecosystem, and no small amount of vibe coding. Modern productivity tooling effectively made this possible, and so we can all "enjoy" this little time capsule.

Maybe this will convince me to write again in a discoverable place, rather than [scrawling everything onto used napkins](https://gist.github.com/djspiewak) and hiding them in a locked filing cabinet in a disused lavatory behind a sign reading "beware the leopard". Or something like that... I would be wise to take my own advice: **If you want to become a better software engineer, become a better writer.**

If you're early in your career, as I was, there is absolutely no better thing you can do than become a better English writer (sorry, the tech world is still very anglo-centric). Even if no one reads what you write, even if you don't benefit from the wild coincidences and lucky encounters which helped me so much, command of the English language and the ability to structure complex topics into a form which meets your audience where they are is unquestionably the most important skill you can build.

There are many, many work days that I go without coding. In fact, most work days, sadly. I don't go a single *hour* without writing.

Thank you for reading.
